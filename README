Connectomics Data Sets
========================

The purpose of this archive is to provide canonical, cleaned-up, properly
normalized versions of various connectomics datasets. All files
are provided in SQLite format. This arose due to the difficulty
of getting both clean data and metadata when working with these data sets. 

Included are the preprocessing scripts and the resulting database, 
but NOT the original data from which the data was derived (which
is under merky copyright status).
