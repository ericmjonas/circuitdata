Connectomics Data Sets
========================

The purpose of this archive is to provide canonical, cleaned-up, properly
normalized versions of various connectomics datasets. All files
are provided in SQLite format. This arose due to the difficulty
of getting both clean data and metadata when working with these data sets. 

Included are the preprocessing scripts and the resulting database, 
but NOT the original data from which the data was derived (which
is under merky copyright status). 

Each dataset is in a separate folder organized by where the data came
from, a readme (containing notes explaining the data, the schema,
etc.), the processing scripts, and the actual DB.

If you are simply looking for an easy-connectivity-matrix to run
algorithm X against, this might not be your target source. My goal is
to provide scientifically-actionable-and-publishable connectivity
and metadata. 

Revisions: 

As bugs in our conversion script are identified, we will update the
data. 

As datasets are revised (corrected), we will update the data. 

Our goal is to never break your existing scientific code depending 
on this data.
